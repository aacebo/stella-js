# Prompts

Used to interact with an LLM via plugins. Different types of prompts can do different things, for example a `text` prompt can use `functions`.

A prompt has a 1 to 1 relationship with the `plugin` it uses, which needs to support the same type that the prompt uses. For example, if you are using an `audio` prompt you would need to also use an `audio` plugin.

> example: how to initialize a prompt that uses OpenAI's `whisper-1` model, which can transcribe audio data. 

```typescript
import { AudioPrompt } from '@stella/core';
import { OpenAIAudioPlugin } from '@stella/openai';

const whisper = new AudioPrompt({
  instructions: 'convert this audio to text',
  plugin: new OpenAIAudioPlugin({
    model: 'whisper-1',
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  })
});
```
